# &lt;mapml-map&gt; Custom Element

The &lt;mapml-map&gt; Custom Element is a [prototype](http://maps4html.github.io/MapML-Map-Custom-Element/) of core mapping functionality suitable for the Web.

## Objective

The objective of this web component is to demonstrate the feasibility of modifying / upgrading the &lt;map&gt; HTML element to support modern Web mapping requirements.  As such, it relies on the new Map Markup Language which delivers map information as hypertext.
This element depends on the [MapML Leaflet Client javascript library](https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML-Leaflet-Client).
