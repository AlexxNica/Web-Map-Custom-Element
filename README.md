# &lt;map&gt; Custom Type Extension Element

The &lt;map&gt; Custom Type Extension Element is a [prototype](http://maps4html.github.io/MapML-Map-Custom-Element/) of core mapping functionality suitable for the Web.

## Objective

The objective of this web component is to demonstrate the feasibility of modifying / upgrading the &lt;map&gt; HTML element to support modern Web mapping requirements.  As such, it relies on [Map Markup Language](http://maps4html.github.io/mapml/spec/) which delivers map information as hypertext.
This element depends on the [MapML Leaflet Client javascript library](https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML-Leaflet-Client).
